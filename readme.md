This is a collection of scripts, that should be used together with the telnet/ssh class available here: <P>
https://github.com/ricky-andre/ssh_telnet_Cisco

The script <B>indentedConversion.py</B> creates an excel output with a list of configuration file, in which the indentation has been used to make them easily filtered using excel filters.

The script <B>ssh_cmd_to_excel.py</B> execeutes a list of commands over a list of routers, using a dictionary that is defined at the beginning of the script. The output is put on an excel file.

The script <B>ssh_same_command_to_excel.py</B> execeutes the same list of commands over a list of routers, and stores the output in an excel file, to be later on processed using powerful filters embedded in excel.
